# Project Description #
The Code Annotation Engine (CAE) is designed to help facilitate code reviews that are done by a team working on a software project.  This need initially arose when it became very cumbersome to share and manage the results for software projects.

# Features #
As CAE has only begun, there is currently no code that is part of the final project.  However, that following is a list of some of the plans for the first few versions of CAE.  The various features will be updated depending on need and the availability of time.

  * Provide annotation and markup to source code.
  * Provide connectivity with a repository.  Subversion will be supported first.
  * Provide a versioning system for the annotations so they can be tracked with a specific version of the source code.  This is necessary due to the fact that the source code will change outside of CAE.
  * Link task annotations to a bug tracking database so that tasks from a code review can be provided directly from CAE and can then be tracked from that point forward.  Initial support is expect for Bugzilla.

# Development #
Initially, CAE will be a standalone application, developed in C# (.NET 3.5).  If it matures, it may be turned into a web application.

Currently, CAE is being worked on as part of a class project.
