#summary Description and list of open-source libraries being used in this project.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Due to the rapid development schedule of this project, when possible, the team will utilize available, .NET, open-source libraries.  The following lists the various libraries, what their purpose is, and the license being used.

== Development Libraries ==

These libraries are .NET libraries and source code which are used within the development of CAE.

=== !SharpSvn ===

From the website:
 !SharpSvn is a binding of the Subversion Client API for .Net 2.0 applications contained within a set of xcopy-deployable dll's.

Because CAE will be working together with Subversion in order to pull down code which will then receive annotations, this library will utilized to make that connection.

*License*: [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html Apache 2.0]

=== !SyntaxBox ===
!SyntaxBox provides a text editor component which has features such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, etc.  This will be necessary to provide an editor so annotations can be added to the final document.

== Icon Libraries ==

Icons are required for the GUI.  There are many beautiful icon libraries on the internet, so the team chose to use those that already existed.
